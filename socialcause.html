        <h1>Healthcare in America</h1>
            <h4>By Dauana Rollins</h4>
            <p>Over 37 million people in the United States live in poverty, with many new foreigners coming into the states, the risk just gets larger of how many will be going without any forms of healthcare. Hourly wages cannot afford to keep up with the alarming increase of prices not to mention the ridiculous cost it takes to recieve proper care. A woman who had birthed premature quadruplets is now forced to pay $4 million dollars for the care her babies recieved while in the hospital. That's two times the amount a person will spend in a lifetime. If change doesn't come soon, many will suffer from this harsh reality. </p>
