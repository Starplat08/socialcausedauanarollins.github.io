        <h2> Welcome to my website and thank you for exploring my tabs, as you may already know my name is Dauana and the reason why I decided to speak about this topic is because many people are struggling daily because they cannot recieve the care that they need, and even though I have medicaid, there's only so much it can cover. I've had a pretty privilaged life and I've also struggled in life, and being able to experience both sides personally has made me realize the seriousness and difference in ones life. I never knew how essential it was to have health insurance until I came of age and the small world I once lived in wasn't so small anymore. It made me realize my view of life was drasitcally different from what I knew and was raised by, I had never knew how crazy expensive it was to be able to recive proper care until hearing others stories and being able to see it for myself. I wish to spread awareness of this matter so others can get to know about it and help make change so more people can be able to afford a better form of healthcare and properly take care of their health as needed. </h2>
