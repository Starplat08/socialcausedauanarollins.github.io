        <h1>The Problem</h1>
             <br>
            <h2>Over 37 million people in the United States live in poverty, with many new foreigners coming into the states, the risk just gets larger of how many will be going without any forms of healthcare. Hourly wages cannot afford to keep up with the alarming increase of prices not to mention the ridiculous cost it takes to recieve proper care. A woman who had birthed premature quadruplets is now forced to pay $4 million dollars for the care her babies recieved while in the hospital. That's two times the amount a person will spend in a lifetime. If change doesn't come soon, many will suffer from this harsh reality. According to Harvard Health Publishing, "Even insured Americans spend more out of pocket for their healthcare than most people in most wealthy nations". The overwhelming cost of healthcare is harsh especially on lower income families but even those who are able to afford still have to pay a pretty penny in order to take care of their health. Ross Univesity stated out of the 11 countries included in Commonwealth fund, the United States spends way more on healthcare than others falling dead last out of the other 11 countries. This goes to show how costly it is to even be able to afford health insurance, not only in rank but also among it's citzens, the United States falls far below the belt in being able to accomodate it's peoples needs.  </h2>
